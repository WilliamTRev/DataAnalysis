All Days:

Also carefully review the following documentation in addition to the above:
https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-users-roles
https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/access-control-and-permission-management
https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-database-connections

Complete LookerReviewQuestions and DWH_BigQuery_Review for practice interview questions. Then practice interviewing with 
others and yourself. Also work on the PracticeProjectWBigQueryAndLooker which is for practice, and you could add to your GitHub.


Note: Comments on topics to double down on that many people missed
- manifest file, what dependencies are included
- access control and layers, what permission sets to use when and what access can a user have, how to give access to a group or group of users
- when prefer aggregate awareness vs caching
